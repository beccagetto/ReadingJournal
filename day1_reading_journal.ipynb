    "Hi everyone.  These are the exercises for the first set of readings from ThinkPython.  While this journal consists of several required exercises, it is meant to encourage active reading more generally.  You should use this journal to take detailed notes, catalog questions, and explore the content from ThinkPython deeply.\n",

Additionally, in order to write text in this document, you will be making use of markdown cells.
